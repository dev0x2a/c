Judges' comments:

    usage: westley <number>

    If you would rather "Daisy" someone other than Westley, rename 
    the program as needed.  :-)

    Read each block of code as if it were a piece of correspondence.
    For example, the first block of code would read:

  charlie,
    doubletime me, OXFACE!
    not interested, get out
    mainly die, charly, *die*
      signed charlotte

    The original source had control-L's after each code block.  To 
    make it easier on news readers, we converted each control-L to 
    a blank line.

    Some ANSI compilers will not accept '1s' as a short integer - for
    these compilers replace the '1s' with '1'.


Selected notes from the author:

    This is a "Picking the Daisy" simulation.  Now, instead of mangling a 
    daisy, simply run this program with the number of petals desired as 
    the argument.
    
    This is a good counter-example to peoples' complaints that C doesn't
    have an "English-like" syntax.
    
    Lint complains about everything - null effect, xxx may be used before
    set, statement not reached, return(e) and return.  Lint dumps core
    on some systems.  My personal favorite lint complaint is
    
      "warning: eroticism unused in function main".
    
    Also obviously, (char)lotte and (char*)lie are incompatible types...
