Game of Life
============

Sean Murphy
-----------

This is my first submission to IOCCC, so I apologize in advance for anything I screw up. That being said, I'm pretty sure my program is "simple" enough that there shouldn't be any problem. 

Compiling: 
----------
c99 yells some warnings at me but it and all other `-std=` that I tried work. I'm using Ubuntu 13 in a VM, but I've even gotten this to work with MinGW in Windows 7. However, it looks ugly in Windows. It should work on pretty much whatever as long as `usleep()` is accepted. 

Running: 
--------
You will want the terminal at 64x33 (33 lines and 64 glyphs per line) in size for best effect. Bigger will work in a pinch. Run the program and watch until you get bored. When bored, CTRL-C or escape somehow. Run it again for a different starting pattern.

The Output: 
-----------
I'm sure you all know Conway's Game of Life already.
