       qsort_r(): _GNU_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The qsort() function sorts an array with nmemb elements of size size.  The base argument points to the start of the array.

       The contents of the array are sorted in ascending order according to a comparison function pointed to by compar, which is called with two arguments that point
       to the objects being compared.

       The comparison function must return an integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero if the first argument is considered to  be  respectively  less  than,
       equal to, or greater than the second.  If two members compare as equal, their order in the sorted array is undefined.

       The qsort_r() function is identical to qsort() except that the comparison function compar takes a third argument.  A pointer is passed to the comparison func‚Äê
       tion via arg.  In this way, the comparison function does not need to use global variables to pass through arbitrary arguments, and is therefore reentrant  and
       safe to use in threads.
