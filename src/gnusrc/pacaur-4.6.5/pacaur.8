.SH "NAME"
pacaur \- an AUR helper that minimizes user interaction
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
Usage: \fIpacaur\fR <operation> [ options ] [ target(s) ]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Pacaur is an Arch User Repository (\s-1AUR\s0) helper aiming at speed and simplicity
and is designed to minimize user prompt interaction. It uses an uncluttered
interface and makes use of the full secured \s-1RPC\s0 interface to solve the dependency
tree. It will also automatically prompt for sudo access when needed. It is built
upon the well designed cower and expac C backends.
.PP
Invoking pacaur consists of supplying an operation, any applicable options, and
usually one or more targets. A \fItarget\fR is usually a package name or a search
string.
.SH "USERBASE TARGET"
.IX Header "USERBASE TARGET"
Pacaur is targeted at \fBadvanced users\fR who want some degree of automation for
repetitive tasks. As such, the user is expected to be familiar with the \s-1AUR\s0
manual build process with makepkg and its configuration options, as well as
being knowledgeable about sudo and gpg configuration.
.PP
Two sets of command line options are provided: commands which call the pacman
binary and extend it with \s-1AUR\s0 functions \fB(\-S, \-Ss, \-Si, \-Sw, \-Su, \-Qu, \-Sc, \-Scc)\fR,
and commands which are \s-1AUR\s0 specific \fB(\-s, \-i, \-d, \-m, \-y, \-k, \-u)\fR. As such,
pacaur can be used by users who prefer to have a single tool to manage the
official and \s-1AUR\s0 repositories, or by users who prefer to keep their \s-1AUR\s0
frontend separated from pacman.
.SH "OPERATIONS"

.IX Item "-S, -Ss, -Si, -Sw, -Su, -Qu, -Sc, -Scc"
Pacaur wraps all \fBpacman operations\fR and by default extends respectively its
install, search, info, download only, update, check updates and clean functions
to the \s-1AUR.\s0 This extension behavior is optional and can be disabled with the
\&\fIfallback\fR variable in the config file. Pacaur will also pass any other pacman
operations and their related options to the pacman binary.

.SH "CONFIG OPTIONS"
.IX Header "CONFIG OPTIONS"
The available options are:
.IP "\fBeditor\fR" 4
.IX Item "editor"
Define the editor. Default is \fB\f(CB$EDITOR\fB\fR, with a fallback on \fIvi\fR.
.IP "\fBdisplaybuildfiles\fR" 4
.IX Item "displaybuildfiles"
Display \s-1PKGBUILD\s0 and install script viewing prompt. Possible values are \fIfull\fR
to always display the full build files, \fIdiff\fR to only display the difference
since last build, and \fInone\fR to disable the viewing prompt. Default is \fBdiff\fR.
.IP "\fBfallback\fR" 4
.IX Item "fallback"
Extend pacman commands to the \s-1AUR.\s0 Default is \fBtrue\fR.
.IP "\fBsilent\fR" 4
.IX Item "silent"
Enable silent output. The makepkg output will be collected in the clone directory
or the \fI\f(CI$LOGDEST\fI\fR directory should any error occur. Default is \fBfalse\fR.
.IP "\fBsortby\fR" 4
.IX Item "sortby"
When searching the \s-1AUR,\s0 sort the results by \fIname\fR, number of \fIvotes\fR or
\&\fIpopularity\fR. Default is \fBpopularity\fR.
.IP "\fBsortorder\fR" 4
.IX Item "sortorder"
When searching the \s-1AUR,\s0 sort the results in \fIascending\fR or \fIdescending\fR order.
Default is \fBdescending\fR.
.IP "\fBsudoloop\fR" 4
.IX Item "sudoloop"
Prevent sudo timeout. This option overrides the system-wide \fIpasswd_timeout\fR
sudo configuration and refreshes the sudo timestamp automatically in a loop when
building packages. Default is \fBtrue\fR.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.IX Header "ENVIRONMENT"
.IP "\fB\s-1AURDEST\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "AURDEST"
Determines where the packages build files (\s-1PKGBUILD, .SRCINFO\s0 and install script
files) will be cloned.
.Sp
If this environment variable is not defined, the clone directory will be set to
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  $XDG_CACHE_HOME/pacaur
.Ve
.Sp
with a fall back to
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  $HOME/.cache/pacaur
.Ve
.PP
In addition, makepkg environment variables are fully honored. See \fBmakepkg\fR(8).
In particular, the following variables are useful:
.IP "\fB\s-1PKGDEST\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "PKGDEST"
Determines where the built packages will be stored. The \fI\-Sc\fR and \fI\-Scc\fR clean
operations allow to remove the non locally installed cached files and all cached
files, respectively. If using the existing \fI/var/cache/pacman/pkg\fR pacman cache
directory, ensure your user has proper write permissions.
.IP "\fB\s-1SRCDEST\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "SRCDEST"
Determines where the source of packages will be stored. This will speed up the
update of development packages. The \fI\-Sc\fR and \fI\-Scc\fR clean operations allow
to remove the non development packages source files and all source files,
respectively.
.IP "\fB\s-1LOGDEST\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "LOGDEST"
Determines where the build logs will be stored. By default, the \fI\-\-silent\fR
option will write build logs in the clone directory if the build fails, but
will remove them if the build succeeds.
.IP "\fB\s-1BUILDDIR\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "BUILDDIR"
Determines where the packages will be built. By default, build will happen in
the defined clone directory, but build speed can be improved by using \fI/tmp\fR
located in volatile memory. This is however not recommended if big packages
need to be built on a low-memory machine.
.SH "NOTES"
.IX Header "NOTES"
.IP "\fBsudo configuration\fR" 4
.IX Item "sudo configuration"
To be used with minimal password prompting, \fIsudo\fR should be configured
accordingly to allow sudo access. See \fBsudoers\fR(5). If you disable the
\&\fIsudoloop\fR config option, you might also want to disable the \fIpasswd_timeout\fR
sudo parameter to avoid password prompt timeout.
.IP "\fBpacman misc options\fR" 4
.IX Item "pacman misc options"
Miscellaneous options enabled in \fIpacman.conf\fR are taken into account. Thus,
colored output can be enabled with the \fIColor\fR option, while a detailed interface
displaying name, version and size of packages formatted as a table is available
through the \fIVerbosePkgLists\fR option.
.IP "\fBbuild files comparison\fR" 4
.IX Item "build files comparison"
To allow build files comparison, the \fIdisplaybuildfiles\fR default config option
is set to \fIdiff\fR. Although the clone directory (set by default to
\&\fI\f(CI$XDG_CACHE_HOME\fI/pacaur\fR) can be changed through the alternative \fI\f(CI$AURDEST\fI\fR
environment variable, it should always be set to a persistent location.
.IP "\fBfallback\fR" 4
.IX Item "fallback"
By default, any operation will be applied on the binary repositories, then the
\&\s-1AUR\s0 if necessary. This behavior is optional and can be disabled with the
\&\fIfallback\fR config option. When disabled, any operation will be restricted to
the binary repositories similarly to pacman, while \s-1AUR\s0 operations can be
applied explicitly with the \fI\-\-aur\fR option.
.IP "\fBinteractive PKGBUILDs\fR" 4
.IX Item "interactive PKGBUILDs"
Packages requiring user input while building are not supported and might fail
to install properly. There is currently no official directive about these
interactive PKGBUILDs, but some of the official pacman developers expressed
the opinion that PKGBUILDs should always provide default compilation options.
.IP "\fBhost name error\fR" 4
.IX Item "host name error"
If a lot of \*(L"Could not connect to the \s-1AUR\*(R"\s0 and \*(L"Timeout was reached\*(R" messages
are displayed while searching or requesting info for packages despite the
internet connection working correctly, ensure your local \fI\s-1DNS\s0 server\fR is
correctly configured to improve name lookups. Using Google's primary \s-1DNS
\&\s0(8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4) might also help.
.IP "\fBalternative installation root\fR" 4
.IX Item "alternative installation root"
The alternative installation root \fI\-r /path\fR short option of pacman is not
supported. Use the \fI\-\-root /path\fR long option instead, or chroot to the new
path and use pacaur from there instead.
